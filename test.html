<p>The type of encoding used to report device data from ThingPark Enterprise to your Cloud application.</p>
<ul>
    <li>JSON encoding is used to report uplink messages, that is from ThingPark Enterprise to the Cloud platform. The
        format depends on the content type configured in the TPE application: "JSON legacy document" or "JSON enriched
        document."
        <ul>
            <li><b>JSON enriched document:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>This format is set by default when Cloud applications are created from ThingPark Enterprise 6.1
                        or newer. It is proposed by default in the ThingPark Enterprise user interface.
                    </li>
                    <li>When the JSON enriched document is used, ThingPark Enterprise sends the following reports to the
                        Cloud application: uplink frame reports, Downlink Sent Indication reports, Location reports, and
                        Device Notification reports. To learn more, check the <a

                            <li>Raw encoded payload is reported in the “payload_hex” field (hexadecimal string).</li>
                            <li>Decoded payload is reported in the “payload” (object).<br/><br/><b>Note:</b> Payload
                                decoding feature is supported for device models that have an associated payload driver
                                in their device profiles: Abeeway, Adeunis, NKE/Watteco, DecentLab, Netvox, etc. The
                                list is growing very fast; contact your support team in case ThingPark does not yet have
                                the proper driver for your device model.

            <li><b>JSON legacy document:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the mode used before the released Thingpark Enterprise 6.1. For the sake of backward
                        compatibility, this mode is maintained for applications created before TPE upgrade to release
                        6.1. However, you can change to JSON enriched if you want to activate the payload decoding
                        feature between TPE and Application Servers. Only uplink messages are transmitted to the
                        Application Server. The payload is reported in raw encoded format, that is not decoded format as
                        opposed to JSON enriched mode.

            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Downlink messages are sent by Cloud applications (AWS, MQTT, Azure, Watson, and ThingWorx) and are therefore not
    impacted by the Content Type setting. For information, the downlink payload is submitted by the Application Server
    to ThingPark Enterprise. It can use raw encoded payload or decoded payload regardless of the value of the Content
    Type." To learn more, click the <a href="https://docs.thingpark.com/thingpark-x/1.3/Overview/">ThingPark_X_IoT_Flow_User_Guide</a>.
