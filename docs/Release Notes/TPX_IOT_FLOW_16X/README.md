![img](images/teams-msg.png)

#### Modbus (OCP only)

This new connector enables use of Modbus by implementing an embedded Modbus slave, collecting uplinks and mapping application payload values to registers according to the configured rules. (TXIF-1051)

![img](images/modbus.png)

Documentation can be found <a href="https://docs.thingpark.com/thingpark-x/latest/Connector/MODBUS/">here</a>

#### OPC UA (OCP only)

![img](images/app_id.png)

Documentation can be found <a href="https://docs.thingpark.com/thingpark-x/latest/Connector/HERE/">here</a>

#### Azure IoT Hub

Azure IoT Hub has a mutual exclusion mechanism for downstream. 

If more than one client try to establish a link on a device, user cannot access to this link. TPX now provides the solution for disabling downstream links. Be aware that the user cannot receive the downlinks this option is used. (TXIF-1350)

#### Azure IoT-Central

* ```deviceTemplateId``` and ```pricingPlan``` fields are removed. (TXIF-1319)

* Device template loading time is improved for supporting complex templates. (TXIF-1177)

#### AWS IoT Core

* Following AWS recommandations, TPX internal connectivity with AWS IoT Core is migrated from MQTT to HTTPS for the uplinks. An MQTT link still exists for receiving the downlinks. (TXIF-1173)

* Proxy support is added. (TXIF-1437)

#### MQTT

* Advanced Settings now contain a set of parameters for a fine-tuning the  use of MQTT Broker. (TXIF-1324 / TXIF-1407 / TXIF-1413)

![img](images/mqtt_settings.png)

### Common connector changes

* Basics connectors that were initially developed based on the DX-Dataflow now supports the legacy options on the UI.

For details, see the ``sendMetadata`` on the common properties section in <a href="https://docs.thingpark.com/thingpark-x/latest/Getting%20started/Setting%20Up%20A%20Connection%20instance/About_connections#common-parameters">the public documentation</a>.  (TXIF-1413)

* Added ``sendRawDecodedFormat`` on MQTT / AWS IoT Core / HTTP / Azure IoT Core which enables delivery of only the decoded payload and not the whole uplink message. (TXIF-1403)

* Created a new message processor to transform the message to the flat format that allows single level of fields. (TXIF-1425)

![img](images/create_operation.png)

* Events are made available on UI. (TXIF-1267)
