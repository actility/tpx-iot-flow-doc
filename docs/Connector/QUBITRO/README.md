## Creating a Connection With API

The creation of a connection establishes a unidirectional messaging transport link to the cloud provider.

To do this, you need to use the **Connections** group resource:
*	`POST/connections` to create a new Connection instance
*	`PUT/connections` to update a Connection instance
*	`DELETE/connections` to delete a Connection instance


::: tip Note
We follow the REST-full API pattern, when updating configuration properties for a connection resource. Thus, you must also provide the whole configuration again.
:::

Example for creation of a new connection instance :

```json
POST /connections
{
  "name":"Actility to Qubitro",
  "connectorId":"actility-http-iot",
  "configuration": {
      "destinationURL":"https://webhook.qubitro.com/integrations/actility",
      "headers": {
        "projectId":"aa62ebe1-7ff3-4d05-baec-e6ff2edf34a4",
        "webhookSigningKey":"NGtFMlNZdEZpRVpmeXRMNFJpbVM1THVJa3EzMg=="
      }
  },
  "brand":"QUBITRO"
}
```

The following table lists the properties applicable to a connection instance.

| Field | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| ```connectorId``` | Must be set to actility-http-iot for Tago platform. |
| ```configuration/projectId``` | Must be replaced by your Project ID, found during device creation. |
| ```configuration/webhookSigningKey``` | Must be replaced by your Webhook Signing Key during device creation. |
| ```brand``` | Must be set to ```QUBITRO```. |

::: warning Important note
All properties are not present in this example. You can check the rest of these properties in the [common parameters section](../../Getting_Started/Setting_Up_A_Connection_instance/About_connections.html#common-parameters).
