# CREATING AN IBM WATSON CONNECTION

This setup is intended to be a minimal setup example to get the Watson IoT connector working.
The Watson IoT connector requires the creation of an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/) upfront.

## Collecting Expected Information

### First time generating all informations

Follow these steps in order to generate all the informations you need.

Go to the [IBM Watson IoT Dashboard](https://myibm.ibm.com/dashboard/)

1. Click the **Devices** link in the left menu, then click on the **Device Types** section, and then click on the **Add Device Type** button.

![img](images/ui/addDeviceType.png)

2. First, create the Gateway type: fill the Name value, click Next.

![img](images/ui/addType.png)

3. Click **Done** to create the gateway Type.

![img](images/ui/typeDone.png)

4. Repeat the same action to create the Device type.

Mettre un tip note warning be sure to copy these infos or else you will have to regenerate them

### Organization ID

Go to the IBM Watson Iot Platform's dashboard page. You should see the Organization ID in the top right corner.

![img](images/ui/organizationId.png)

### API Key

On the Watson dashboard right corner or in the url you can find the orgId value:
https://936ou1.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/dashboard/devices/browse

![img](images/orgId.png)

1. Click the **Devices** link in the left menu, then click on the **Device Types** section, and then click on the **Add Device Type** button.

![img](images/ui/addDeviceType.png)

2. Create first the Gateway type: fill the Name value, click **Next** and on the next page click **Done**.

![img](images/createGateway.png)

![img](images/createGatewayDone.png)

3. Repeat the same action for creating the Device type.

![img](images/createDevice.png)

4. On the **Device Types** list you should see the newly created Device types:

![img](images/newDevice.png)

5. Create now a Gateway. Go to **Device** and click **Add Device**:

![img](images/addDevice.png)

6. On **Identity** tab select the gateway type previously created, fill the gateway id and click **Next**.

![img](images/gatewayId.png)

7. On the **Device information** tab click **Next**.

![img](images/deviceInfo.png)

8. On the **Permissions** tab select **Privileged Gateway** and click Next (read [this](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/iot/) to understand the difference between Standard and Privileged Gateway):

![img](images/permissionGateway.png)

9. On the **Security** tab leave Authentication Token empty to let Watson auto-generate one for you and click **Next**.

![img](images/securityTab.png)

10. On **Summary** tab click **Done**.

![img](images/summaryTab.png)

11.	On the final page you have the Organization ID and all gateway info required for the connection configuration:

+ Organization ID is the **orgId**
+ Device ID is the **gatewayId**
+ Device Type is the **gatewayType**
+ Authentication Token is the **gatewayToken**.
     Copy and save this token because generated Authentication tokens are non-recoverable.

![img](images/deviceCredentials.png)

12. After this we need to create an API Key/token to be used for listing/registering devices under the gateway Device that we created.
13. Select **Apps** from the left menu and click **Generate API Key**.

![img](images/generateAPIKey.png)

14. On the **Information** tab select a desired API Key Expiration date and click **Next**:

![img](images/apiKeyDate.png)

15.	On the **Permissions** tab, select **Standard Application** Role and click **Generate Key**:

![img](images/permissionTab.png)

16.	On the final page you get the generated API Key/Token need it for connection configuration:

+ API Key is the **apiKey**
+ Authentication Token is the **apiToken**.
     Copy and save this token because generated Authentication tokens are non-recoverable.

## Creating an IBM Watson IoT Platform

1. To create an IBM Watson IoT Platform go to [IBM Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/) and select **Create resource**.

![img](images/createResource.png)

2. Select **Internet Of Things** Platform:

![img](images/iotPlatform.png)

3. Select the region to deploy the application

![img](images/ui/selectLocation.png)

4. Select the pricing plan. For a demo, the Lite/free plan should be ok. For production select a paid plan that fits your needs.

![img](images/ui/free.png)

5. Fill in the service name, select the region to deploy and create the organization/space if needed. After filling the form, click **Create**.

![img](images/ui/configureResource.png)

6.	Finally, on the next screen, click **Launch** to start the IoT Platform:

![img](images/ui/launchPlatform.png)

* You will be redirected to the newly created IBM Watson IoT Platform dashboard. Do not forget to copy the organization ID.

## Creating a Connection With API

MQTT over TLS is the protocol used by Watson.
You need to create the connection prior to creating the flow.
The creation of a connection establishes a link from ThingPark Wireless to the cloud provider that you want to associate a Device with. The link can be used to transport any Uplink regardless the DevEUI parameter.
To do this, you need to use the following endpoints:

+ ```POST/connections``` for creation
+ ```PUT/connections``` for modification
+ ```DELETE/connections``` for deletion

:::tip Note
When you update a configuration property on a connection, you must provide the whole configuration properties again.
:::

Example of the creation of a connection.

```json
    POST /connections

{
  "connectorId": "actility-watson-iot",
  "name": "Watson Demo Connection",
  "configuration": {
    "description": "Watson Datacenter",
    "orgId": "936ou1",
    "deviceType": "actilitydevicetype",
    "gatewayType": "actilitygatewaytype",
    "gatewayId": "actilitygateway",
    "gatewayToken": "GXvfTVxJXoI@Z(ufxU",
    "apiKey": "a-936ou1-4ocurmbrva",
    "apiToken": "SgbW?FYqeK6&amp;sIhDoe"
  }
}
```

The following table lists the expected results of the properties when applied:

| Property | Expected results |
| ------| -----------|
| ```connectorId```   | Set to ```actility-watson-iot``` |
| ```configuration/orgId``` | Organization id of the Watson IoT account. |
| ```configuration/gatewayId```    | Id of the Watson IoT gateway used by the connector. |
| ```configuration/gatewayType``` | Watson IoT gateway type of the Watson IoT gateway used by the connector. |
| ```configuration/gatewayToken``` | Authentication token of the Watson IoT gateway used by the connector. |
| ```configuration/deviceType``` | 	Watson IoT Device type to be associated with the Devices processed by the connector. |
| ```configuration/apiKey``` | API Key of the Watson IoT application to be associated with the connector. |
| ```configuration/apiToken``` | Authentication Token of the Watson IoT application to be associated with the connector. |

:::warning Important note
All properties are not present in this example. You can check the rest of these properties in the [common parameters section](../../../Getting_Started/Setting_Up_A_Connection_instance/About_connections.html#common-parameters).
:::

## Creating a Connection From UI

1. Click Connections -&gt; Create -&gt; ThingPark X IoT Flow.

![img](images/ui/create_connection.png)

Then, a new page will open. Select the connection type : IBM Watson IoT.

![img](images/ui/create_ibm.png)

2. Fill in the form as in the example below and click on **Create**.

![img](images/ui/form_filled.png)

## Limitations

Look on Watson IoT Platform [Quotas](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP8H/iot/platform/reference/quotas.html) for choosing a Watson plan that suits your needs.
We recommend that you use the Standard plan for production and the lite plan for testing purposes.

## Displaying Information to Know if it Worked

1. Go to the Watson dashboard and select **Device** from the left menu.
2. Select the Device that you want to monitor and go to **Recent Events** tab and wait for uplinks to be displayed.
      You should see something like this:
