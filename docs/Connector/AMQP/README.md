# CREATING AN AMQP CONNECTION

## Creating a Connection With API

The creation of a connection establishes a bidirectional messaging transport link between ThingPark X IoT Flow and the cloud provider. Events and commands from multiple Devices will be multiplexed over this messaging transport link.

To do this, you need to use the **Connections** group resource:

* `POST/connections` to create a new Connection instance
* `PUT/connections` to update a Connection instance
* `DELETE/connections` to delete a Connection instance

:::tip Note
We follow the REST-full API pattern, when updating configuration properties for a connection resource. Thus, you must also provide the whole configuration again.
:::

Example for creation of a new connection instance :

* AMQP connection with **TCP**

```json
POST /connections
{
    "connectorId": "actility-amqp-0.9.1-iot",
    "name": "Actility AMQP (TCP) Connection",
    "configuration": {
        "uplinkTopicPattern": "amqp.things.{DevEUI}.uplink",
        "downlinkTopicPattern": "amqp.things.{DevEUI}.downlink",
        "hostName": "amqp.actility.com:5672",
        "protocol": "TCP",
        "username": "mycompany",
        "password": "mypassword",
        "exchangeName": "IotFlowExchange"
    }
}
```

* AMQP connection with **SSL**

```json
{
    "connectorId": "actility-amqp-0.9.1-iot",
    "name": "Actility AMQP (SSL) Connection",
    "configuration": {
        "uplinkTopicPattern": "amqp.things.{DevEUI}.uplink",
        "downlinkTopicPattern": "amqp.things.{DevEUI}.downlink",
        "hostName": "amqp.actility.com:5671",
        "protocol": "SSL",
        "username": "mycompany",
        "password": "mypassword",
        "certificate": "--BEGIN CERTIFICATE--kCFGNqMDBA...QJvW3--END CERTIFICATE--",
        "privateKey": "--BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY--MIIEowIBAA...lOF5whZXzrHHACsWqAwermxHK7--END RSA PRIVATE KEY--",
        "exchangeName": "IotFlowExchange"
    }
}
```

The following table lists the properties applicable to a connection instance.

| JSON Field | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| ```connectorId``` | Must be set to actility-amqp-0.9.1-iot for AMQP platform. |
| ```uplinkTopicPattern``` | Defines a pattern of topic for the Uplink. |
| ```downlinkTopicPattern``` | Defines a pattern of topic for the Downlink. |
| ```hostName``` | The Hostname and Port of your AMQP server. Example: amqp.company.com:5672. |
| ```protocol``` | Protocol to be used for your connection to the AMQP server. Can be set to TCP or SSL. |
| ```certificate``` | The client certificate file used to connect to your AMQP server. Only needed if protocol is set to SSL. |
| ```privateKey``` | The client private key file used to connect to your AMQP server. Only needed if protocol is set to SSL. |
| ```exchangeName``` | The exchange name e.g. amqp.topic |

:::warning Important note
All properties are not present in this example. You can check the rest of these properties in the [common parameters section](../../../Getting_Started/Setting_Up_A_Connection_instance/About_connections.html#common-parameters).

## Creating a Connection From UI

You must have deployed a AMQP server prior to connecting with the AMQP protocol-based application.

| UI Field | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Application Name** | Name of the application that you want to register (Editable). |
| **Hostname** | The Hostname and Port of your AMQP server. Example: amqp.actility.com:5672. (Editable) |
| **Uplink Topic Pattern** | Defines a pattern of topic for the Uplink. (Editable) |
| **Downlink Topic Pattern** | Defines a pattern of topic for the Downlink. (Editable) |
| **Protocol** | Choose between the SSL protocol or the TCP protocol. (Editable) |
| **Certificate** | The client certificate file used to connect to your AMQP server. (Editable) |
| **Private Key** | The client private key file used to connect to your AMQP server. (Editable) |
| **AMQP Username** | The username to access your AMQP server. (Editable) |
| **AMQP Password** | The password used to access your AMQP server. (Editable) |
| **Exchange Name** |The exchange name e.g. amqp.topic (Editable) |

1. Click Connections -> Create -> ThingPark X Iot Flow.

2. Fill in the form as in the example below and click on **Create**.

:::warning Warning
The form changes depending on the protocol selected: SSL or TCP.

:::tip Note
Parameters marked with * are mandatory.
:::

* A notification appears on the upper right side of your screen to confirm that the application has been created.

**Changing the Settings after Creation**

You can change the settings parameters such as the email or the password after the creation of the AMQP application.

To do this, proceed as follows:

1. Select the AMQP application for which you want to change one or several parameters.

2. In the application information dashboard, click on the **Edit** button corresponding to the parameter you want to change.

## Limitations

There are currently no known limitations to the AMQP connector.

## Displaying Information to Know if it Worked

1. Open a new RabbitMQ Management window and click on the **Connections** section.
