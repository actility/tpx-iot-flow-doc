# IoT Flow API

If you want to directly interact with the API go to [Swagger UI](../../swagger-ui/index.html?urls.primaryName=IoT%20Flow%20API)

## Concepts

The ThingPark X IoT Flow API is an API allowing to control the stream of messages (uplinks) generated by a device
and the stream of commands (downlinks) sent to a device. It is a bidirectional flow linking device infrastructures to
cloud platforms.

A flow is composed of a pre-defined set of modules designed to address the problematics raised by the IoT field:

|Module name|Description|
|-|-|
|binder|This is the source of the IoT Flow connecting the device infrastructure to the ThingPark X IoT Flow platform. It is in charge of ingesting messages coming from a device and pushing commands to a device using the protocol exposed by the device infrastructure|
|driver|This is a core part of the ThingPark X IoT Flow framework. It is the module responsible of decoding device messages and encoding commands targeting it. Optionally, it is capable of automatically configure a device or detect its capabilities|
|processor|This is a module responsible of treating device messages and to produce new data by analyzing it. It is called in parallel after the driver output|
|connector|This is destination of the IoT Flow connecting the ThingPark X IoT Flow platform to a cloud platform. It is in charge of pushing messages coming from a device to the cloud and ingesting commands targeting a device from the cloud using the protocol exposed by the cloud platform|

Here is a complete representation of a flow:

## Levels of representation

Device messages and commands are expressed using three different levels of representation in the ThingPark X IoT Flow
framework:

|Level|Description|
|-|-|
|raw|This is the raw view of an uplink or downlink. Basically, this is the byte array that is received/sent from/to the device on the device infrastructure|
|message|This is the uplink/downlink view as defined by the driver provider. This is an abstract proprietary JSON node|
|thing|This is the device representation in the IoT Flow framework. It is a generic view of the device composed of points which is the data coming from the device and commands exposed by the device. Optionally, points and/or commands can follow on ontology which means they share the same representation to allow device interworking|

Basically, it is the driver module which is responsible of enriching messages flowing in the IoT Flow with the missing
representations
